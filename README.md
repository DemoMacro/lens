### Essential Configuration

Only one environment variable is required:

```env
# Required: Authentication secret
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-here
```

### Optional Configuration

All other configurations are optional and will gracefully degrade:

```env
# Database (defaults to SQLite)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/lens

# OAuth Providers
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret

# Image proxy security
ALLOWED_DOMAINS=example.com,cdn.example.com

# Caching (significantly improves performance - 24-hour default cache)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Cloud storage (for production)
# Note: Vercel Blob and Cloudflare R2 are supported for storage only
# but not for hosting due to serverless limitations
# VERCEL_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your-token
# CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id

# MinIO S3-compatible storage (for Docker Compose development)
# S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000

## üì° API Reference

All API responses include intelligent caching headers with 24-hour cache duration for optimal performance. Responses include `X-Cache` headers indicating cache status (HIT/MISS).

### Authentication

Lens supports multiple authentication methods for API access:

#### 1. API Keys (Recommended for GET requests)

```bash
# Header authentication
curl -H "x-api-key: your_api_key_here" \
  "https://api.bysages.com/img/w_300,f_webp/https://example.com/image.jpg"

# Query parameter (less secure, but convenient)
curl "https://api.bysages.com/img/w_300,f_webp/https://example.com/image.jpg?api_key=your_api_key_here"

# Bearer token format (if API key format)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here" \
  "https://api.bysages.com/screenshot?url=https://example.com"
```

#### 2. Bearer Tokens (for session-based auth)

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_session_token" \
  "https://api.bysages.com/api/endpoint"
```

### Image Processing

Transform and optimize images on-the-fly:

```
GET /img/{modifiers}/{image_url}
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Resize to 300px width, convert to WebP
/img/w_300,f_webp/https://example.com/image.jpg

# Create 200x200 square thumbnail
/img/s_200x200,q_80/https://example.com/image.png

# Smart crop with high quality
/img/w_400,h_300,c_fill,q_95/https://example.com/photo.jpg

# With API key authentication
curl -H "x-api-key: your_key" \
  "https://api.bysages.com/img/w_300,f_webp/https://example.com/image.jpg"
```

**Supported Modifiers:**

- `w_XXX` - Width

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Lens is built with modern web standards and follows clean architecture principles:

### Core Technologies

- **Runtime**: Node.js 22+ with Nitro
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type safety
- **Authentication**: Better-auth with plugin system
- **Image Processing**: IPX with Sharp
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright with pool management
- **Caching**: Multi-layer with unstorage
- **Database**: Adaptive with Kysely (SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL/Turso)

### Design Principles

- **KISS (Keep It Simple)**: Simple, focused solutions over complex abstractions
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Shared utilities and configurations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallbacks for missing dependencies
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- **Performance First**: Optimized for speed and efficiency

## üöÄ Deployment

### Docker Compose (Recommended for Development)

For local development with full service stack, see [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml):

```bash
# Start all services (app, PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO)
docker-compose up -d
```

The setup includes PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, and the main application on port 3000.

### Nitro Deployment

Lens is built with Nitro, which supports multiple deployment targets. For comprehensive deployment options and platform-specific configurations, please refer to the official [Nitro Deployment Guide](https://nitro.build/deploy).

**‚ö†Ô∏è Platform Compatibility Notice:**

This application requires a **persistent runtime environment** and **does not support serverless platforms** like:

- ‚ùå Vercel (Functions)
- ‚ùå Cloudflare Workers/Pages
- ‚ùå Netlify Functions
- ‚ùå AWS Lambda
- ‚ùå Azure Functions

**‚úÖ Recommended platforms for persistent runtime:**

- Traditional VPS/Dedicated servers
- Docker containers
- **Docker Compose** (for development and production)
- Platform.sh
- Render.com
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- Heroku
- Any platform with persistent Node.js 22+ runtime

**Note:** While Railway and Zeabur may work with Nixpacks, they are not officially supported by Nitro. Use at your own discretion.

### Nixpacks Deployment

This project includes Nixpacks configuration for seamless deployment on platforms that support it. For comprehensive Nixpacks usage and platform-specific configurations, please refer to the [official Nixpacks documentation](https://nixpacks.com/docs/getting-started).

Nixpacks provides automatic deployment for platforms including:

- Railway
- Zeabur
- Render.com
- And other Nixpacks-compatible platforms

See [`nixpacks.toml`](nixpacks.toml) for build configuration. The setup includes:

- **Node.js 22** runtime with **pnpm 10+** package management
- **System dependencies** for image processing and screenshot capabilities
- **Optimized builds** with runtime image separation for smaller deployment size

### Why Not Serverless?

This application requires features that are incompatible with serverless environments:

1. **üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Browser Pool Management**: Playwright browser instances need persistent memory and connection pooling
2. **üì¶ Native Dependencies**: Sharp, better-sqlite3, and chromium require filesystem access and binary execution
3. **üîÑ Long-Running Processes**: Image processing and screenshot capture can exceed serverless timeout limits
4. **üíæ Persistent Storage**: Database connections and cache systems need persistent runtime
5. **üéØ Connection Reuse**: Performance optimizations rely on keeping connections alive

**Recommended Platforms**: Render.com, Platform.sh, DigitalOcean App Platform, Heroku, Traditional VPS

### Environment Variables

Configure the following environment variables in your deployment platform:

```env
# Required
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-here

# Optional (for enhanced functionality)
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
REDIS_URL=your-redis-url
# ... other environment variables from env.example
```
